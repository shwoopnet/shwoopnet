# FORWARD LEDGER (automatic; research only)

Written by `python -m scalper.fwdledger run` (once per AUTO pass, `scalper.autoscore check`). Last updated 2026-10-29 23:39 UTC.
Forward evidence counts only windows that CLOSED after a candidate's freeze time, had the data its rule needs and have settled.
Fees 7% x C x p x (1-p) rounded up to the cent per order, at 1 and 10 contracts; held to settlement pays the entry fee only. Win = net at 10 contracts above zero. Net per contract is at 10 contracts. Trades per week: forward trades over the time from the freeze to the last evaluated close.
This ledger never promotes anything. READY FOR THE FALSIFIER means only: forward PF 1.5+ at 1 and at 10 contracts on 30+ trades over 10+ trade days. It earns a falsifier read, nothing more. How a generator adds a candidate: `workers/candidates/README.md`.

## History per candidate

### REF_L1_GOLD

Evaluator `scalper.fwdeval:l1_like`, source `candles`, frozen 2026-10-30T00:00:00Z. The live L1 gold rule as a known baseline: the side whose ask is 0.88 to 0.97 at the candle ending 6 minutes before the close, bought at that ask, held to settlement. Candles only, so it ignores the live 25c exit and the window limit.
Windows evaluated 0 on 0 days; without the data the rule needs 0; evaluator errors 0. Trades 0 on 0 days; zero-volume trades 0.
PF at 1 contract 0.00, at 10 contracts 0.00, at 10 contracts with fees x1.2 0.00; net per contract +0.00c at 1, +0.00c at 10.
