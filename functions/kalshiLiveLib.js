// The one-time LIVE test order: step 1 of the owner's decision to put a small amount of real money behind this
// (recorded in kalshi-scalper/README.md). It proves the real-money plumbing (production signing, a real fill, the
// real fee, the real duplicate-order behaviour) with ONE contract. It is not the bot and cannot become it:
//
// - One contract, a hard $2.00 cap including the fee, Bitcoin only, immediate-or-cancel so nothing rests.
// - Fails closed. It does nothing unless the switch KALSHI_LIVE_ENABLED is "on" (default off), the bot is not
//   halted, the exchange is trading and the account balance is readable and enough.
// - Hard totals: at most 2 a day and 5 ever. Past that this module refuses until a person edits it.
// - NEVER retried. On the demo a lost answer could be re-sent safely because a repeat is refused with HTTP 409;
//   on production that is not yet confirmed (the point of this step). So an ambiguous answer (no reply, a
//   timeout, a 5xx) is recorded as "unknown", tells the owner to look at the Kalshi account, and blocks every
//   further live test until that record is dealt with by hand.
// - The order id is derived from the market (L-<ticker>), never random, and the record is created first and
//   atomically, so a double click or a second instance cannot send it twice.
// - Production host only (the demo module refuses production, and this one refuses everything else). The key
//   lives in Firebase secrets, signs and is never logged, recorded or returned.
//
// The scheduled bot (kalshiBotLib.js, kalshiBotRun.js, exports.kalshiBot) still has no order code.
